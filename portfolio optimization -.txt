portfolio optimization :-


	finding the best mix of assets for high return & low risk.

Use of Portfolio Optimization

Portfolio Optimization is used in finance/investing to:

Choose the best mix of assets (stocks, bonds, etc.)

Maximize return ðŸ’µ

Minimize risk ðŸ“‰

Follow constraints (budget, diversification, risk tolerance).

ðŸ‘‰ Example: You have â‚¹100 to invest in 3 stocks. Which stocks (and how much in each) give you the highest return with the lowest risk? Thatâ€™s portfolio optimization.

ðŸ”¹ Features to Implement in Portfolio Optimization

When building a portfolio optimization solution (classical or quantum), you usually include:

Expected Returns

The average return you expect from each asset.

Risk (Covariance / Variance)

How much the assetâ€™s price fluctuates.

Covariance shows how assets move together (important for diversification).

Constraints

Budget (how much money you have).

Number of assets (e.g., must pick 2 out of 5).

Minimum or maximum allocation per asset.

Objective Function

A mathematical formula that balances risk vs. return.

Example: Minimize (Risk â€“ Return).

Optimization Method

Classical â†’ Linear/Quadratic programming.

Quantum â†’ QAOA, VQE with Qiskit.

Output (Optimal Portfolio)

Which assets to include.

How much money to allocate to each.

The risk-return tradeoff.
